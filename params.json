{"name":"EasyXT","tagline":"Simplifying the use of Imaris within Matlab","body":"## What is EasyXT\r\nNot a classical XTension for Imaris, EasyXT aims to make communication between Imaris and Matlab more _Matlab-like_, that is trying to hide all those strange calls that are more reminiscent of a Java application and not an Matlab Script. \r\n\r\nInstead of having very strict calls to Imaris methods, we offer a _Name, Value_ pair approach to all optional input parameters. \r\n\r\nWe currently implement functions for the following:\r\n* __Accessing objects by type, name and number__\r\n  * `GetObject()`\r\n  * `SelectDialog()`\r\n  * `GetNumberOf()`\r\n* __Spot Creation__\r\n  * `CreateSpots()` \r\n  * `DetectSpots()`\r\n* __Surface Creation__\r\n  * `DetectSurfaces()`\r\n* __Colocalization__\r\n  * `Coloc()`\r\n* __And Many More...__\r\n  * Use `doc EasyXT` from __Matlab__ to see the full list of functions\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nAll EasyXT needs is the path to the Imaris Application \r\n(Usually something like `C:\\Program Files\\Bitplane\\Imaris x64 7.6.5\\Imaris.exe`).\r\nThis is so that EasyXT can find the `ImarisLib.jar` file.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you can run \r\n```matlab\r\nXT = EasyXT('setup');\r\n```\r\nThis will prompt the user to provide the location of `Imaris.exe` and will store this information in a text file called `config.txt`\r\n\r\n### Alternative setup\r\nIf you have `EasyXT.m` on the same folder as `Imarislib.jar` this setup is not necessary.\r\n\r\n## List of Functions\r\nThe simplest thing is for you to call \r\n```matlab\r\ndoc EasyXT\r\n```\r\nTo see all the methods that are available to you. We strive to give you as complete information as possible. \r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nWe have set up the following GISTS to help you get started\r\n* [Using EasyXT inside an XTension] (https://gist.github.com/lacan/47253fb7b9b42047e158)\r\n* [Colocalization example (Matlab Script)] (https://gist.github.com/lacan/be7cfba6ba1d26594598)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis XTension was created by Olivier Burri (@lacan) and Romain Guiet (@romainGuiet) at the [BioImaging & Optics Platform (BIOP)] (http://biop.epfl.ch).
