A Matlab Xtension for Imaris. 

This XTension can help simplify the interaction between Matlab and Imaris when writing XTensions. More documentation to come.

You can also have a look to [EasyXT-GUI](https://github.com/BIOP/EasyXT-GUI), a simple Matlab GUI to leverage EasyXT and centralize complex analysis pipelines in Imaris.
